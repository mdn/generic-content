- #### 2005

  [DevMo by Mozilla](https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2005/02/23/devmo-and-devedge-updates/),
  a community-driven wiki dedicated to documenting open web standards.

  ![Screenshot of MDN homepage from January 2005](https://mdn.dev/generic-content/about/screenshots/20050121103200-960x540@1x.png)

- #### 2010

  Rebranded as
  [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/08/introducing-the-new-mdn-website/),
  reinforcing our commitment to the developer community.

  ![Screenshot of MDN homepage from September 2010](https://mdn.dev/generic-content/about/screenshots/20100901014818-960x540@1x.png)
  
- #### 2017

  Achieved a milestone when major tech companies began contributing and
  supporting web documentation on our platform, solidifying MDN as the central
  hub for web development knowledge.

- #### 2020

  Transitioned from its wiki-based origins to a modern,
  [GitHub-hosted project](https://github.com/mdn) with the launch of Yari,
  modernizing our infrastructure and workflows.

  Unveiled a
  [major redesign](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/03/a-new-year-a-new-mdn/) and

  offering personalized features for an enhanced user experience.
  
  ![Screenshot of MDN homepage from April 2022](https://mdn.dev/generic-content/about/screenshots/20220402010722-1280x720@1x.png)

- #### 2023/2024

  Launched new tools, including Playground for coding experiments, AI Help for
  easier content discovery, and HTTP Observatory for website security scans. We
